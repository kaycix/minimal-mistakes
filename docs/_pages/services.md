Custom Color Matching: We will match any colors you choose from the simple French manicure
translucents, through the full range of single and mixed-color enamels to special effects.
Start-up Assistance: We recognize that new projects must begin with sampling for market trials and
therefore offer small batch and packaging capability ranging down into the tens and hundreds of bottles

per color.
Large-scale Production: As you continue to grow, we can handle your need for larger production runs
through our partner contract packagers. Our manufacturing facility is currently configured to produce up
to 50,000 gallons of polish per year (equivalent to 12 million 0.5 oz bottles), needing six months lead time
to double that capacity. We are allied with a toll manufacturer who can provide further capacity when
needed.
