<h6>Performance</h6>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Non-toxic:</b> Our polish contains nothing more than water, acrylic resins, a water-soluble co-solvent and FD&C-approved pigments. If an ingredient is not listed on our label, it is not in the polish â€“ not even the minutest quantities.
</li>
<li>
<b>Appearance in the bottle:</b> The resin we use is an emulsion and therefore imparts a milky appearance. Upon drying, however, ir forms a clear, very glossy film.
</li>
<li>
<b>Odor:</b> The solvent in our polish is water and so, unlike traditional polishes that must use strong, stinky solvents, ours is very nearly odorless.
</li>
<li>
<b>Application:</b> The polish flows from the brush to apply evenly with little effort, and with a luxurious feeling, then flows to a uniformly flat film that contains zero brush marks.
</li>
<li>
<b>Dry time:</b> Dry time ranges from 30 to 60 seconds and is strongly influenced by temperature and humidity. Mar and scratch resistance begin to develop immediately thereafter allowing you to use your hands for normal tasks and then reach their maximum values in a matter of several hours,
</li>
<li>
<b>Durability:</b> Treat this polish with care for the first few hours after it is applied and you will be rewarded with scratch and chip resistance comparable to that of the best lacquer polishes on the market.
(Our patented primer doubles this chip resistance. However, the active adhesion promoter in the primer cannot be sold in the EU where all ingredients are required to be INCI listed).
