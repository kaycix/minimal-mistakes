Mad River Science is a cosmetic manufacturer exclusively devoted to the production of water-based nail
polish. We have been doing this for nearly 20 years, gradually improving and refining our formulas into
what we know through extensive feedback from world-wide sales to be the best waterbased nail polish on
the planet with performance at least equal to the best lacquer polishes available. We have recently
partnered with Interpolymer, a subsidiary of Zschimmer and Schwartz Cosmetics, manufacturer of the
resin we use in our polish, to offer our nailpolish for private/white label sales to the cosmetic
industry. Because of their steadfast commitment as our supplier, this partnership offers tremendous
advantages in this age of unreliable, intermittent supply of raw materials by insuring a constant and timely
source of resin, the key ingredient in our formulation.
