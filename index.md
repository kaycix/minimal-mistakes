<h2>About</h2>

Mad River Science is a cosmetic manufacturer exclusively producing water-based nail polish. With nearly 20 years of gradual improvements and refinements, our formulas have received extensive feedback from world-wide sales and are recognized as the best water-based nail polish on the planet with performance equal to or better than the best available lacquer polishes.

A partnership with Interpolymer, a subsidiary of Zschimmer and Schwartz Cosmetics, the manufacturer of the resin used in our polish, allows us to offer our nail polish for private/white label sales to the cosmetic industry. Their steadfast commitment as our supplier offers tremendous advantages in this age of unreliable, intermittent supply of raw materials by insuring a constant and timely source of resin, the key ingredient in our formulation.
