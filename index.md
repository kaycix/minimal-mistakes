<ul>
<li>
You might want to begin with a pallete of your own colors: we will custom match whatever colors you choose.

Your trial testing might require only a few hundred bottle of each color: we will make those small batches and bottle and label them for you.

As your trial marketing expands, your needs will grow to require multiple gallons of each color: we will scale up our production volume and arrange for packaging multiple hundreds or thousands of bottles at our sister facilities.

<h6>About</h6>

<p>
Mad River Science is a cosmetic manufacturer exclusively producing water-based nail polish. With nearly 20 years of gradual improvements and refinements, our formulas have received extensive feedback from world-wide sales and are recognized as the best water-based nail polish on the planet with performance equal to or better than the best available lacquer polishes.
</p>
<p>
A partnership with Interpolymer, a subsidiary of Zschimmer and Schwartz Cosmetics, the manufacturer of the resin used in our polish, allows us to offer our nail polish for private/white label sales to the cosmetic industry. Their steadfast commitment as our supplier offers tremendous advantages in this age of unreliable, intermittent supply of raw materials by insuring a constant and timely source of resin, the key ingredient in our formulation.
